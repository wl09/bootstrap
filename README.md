# bootstrap

This project shows how I used Bootstrap to build a clean, responsive website.

The navbar uses Bootstrap’s classes to be mobile-friendly and stay fixed at the top.

I used full-width containers (container-fluid) for big sections, and regular containers (container) to center content.

The grid system helped me make the form responsive, with two columns on medium screens and up.

Images are made responsive and styled with Bootstrap classes like img-fluid and rounded-circle.

I used Bootstrap’s display utilities like d-none and d-md-block to show or hide stuff depending on screen size.

Forms and buttons are styled easily with Bootstrap classes for a neat look.

Tables get the Bootstrap treatment too, making them look good and scroll nicely on smaller screens.

Basically, Bootstrap made it way easier to get a site that looks good and works well on any device.
